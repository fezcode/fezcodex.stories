# The Fredsound Legacy

## The Gilded Cage of Hamitonis

Hamitonis was a city that never slept, not because of productivity, but because the flash of cameras and the neon lights of celebrity parties never allowed the darkness to settle. It was a place where reputation was currency and empathy was a forgotten relic.

In the heart of this glamorous rot lived **Rainhold Fredsound**. As the head of **Fredsound Dream Studios**, he was perhaps the most powerful man in the city. Yet, Rainhold was an anomaly. While his peers flaunted their cruelty as status symbols, Rainhold spent his nights organizing secret charities, hiding his kindness like a shameful secret. He hated Hamitonis, but he was bound to it by the legacy of his family’s studio.

His only true confidant was **Kramen Mandora**, his butler. Kramen was more than a servant; he was the iron pillar that held Rainhold’s world together. Strict, impeccably dressed, and always aware of his station, Kramen carried the scars of a different world. He was an orphan from **Glareach**, a city now reduced to ash and memory.

Years ago, Rainhold’s mother, **Isabylle Fredsound**, had been driving through Glareach for a gentrification project proposed by **Aester Cloudwear**. Isabylle, seeing the soul of the city, refused to destroy it. Aester’s fury manifested as a "car accident." It was Kramen, then just a boy of the streets, who had pulled Isabylle from the wreckage. In return, she saved him from the coming war by bringing him into the Fredsound household.

## The Star and the Shadow

The party at Fredsound Dream Studios was louder than usual. Amidst the sea of plastic smiles, a woman named **Elyka** appeared. She was a rising star, but as Rainhold approached her, he found his wealth and status meant nothing. He flirted, he offered the world, but Elyka looked through him as if he were made of glass.

"She is unimpressed, Kramen," Rainhold whispered later that night.
"Perhaps, sir, she sees the man instead of the studio," Kramen replied, his voice dry.

Despite her indifference, Rainhold insisted on escorting Elyka to her hotel. She accepted, more out of courtesy than interest. 

## The Counting Gun

The drive was quiet until the world exploded. An ambush, perfectly executed, blocked the road. It was a mirror of the accident that had claimed Isabylle’s peace years ago. The chauffeur was killed instantly as the car spun into a crash.

When the smoke cleared, only Kramen was standing. Rainhold was bleeding, and Elyka lay unconscious in the back.

Kramen Mandora did not panic. He stepped out of the wreckage, drawing a sleek black pistol with the grace of a man who had been waiting for this moment his entire life.

*Bang.* 
"Ten," Kramen whispered. The first assassin fell.
*Bang.*
"Nine." A headshot silenced the second.
*Bang.*
"Eight." The third attacker took a bullet to the leg.
*Bang.*
"Seven." The same man’s hand shattered as he tried to aim.

The third man, fueled by desperation, fired back. A bullet grazed Kramen’s shoulder, tearing through his expensive suit. Kramen didn't flinch. He leveled his gun and fired one more time.
*Bang.*
"Six," Kramen yelled into the night. He knew this choreography. He had lived it in Glareach.

## Nowhere

Kramen rushed back to the car. The chauffeur was gone. Rainhold was conscious but weak. But when Kramen looked for Elyka, the seat was empty. There was no trace of the star.

He pulled Rainhold from the debris, moving him toward the safety of the sidewalk.
"It is not safe here," Kramen muttered, his eyes darting across the shadows. He pulled out a communicator to call the Fredsound emergency response team.

Rainhold gripped Kramen’s arm, his voice trembling. "Kramen... where is she? Where is Elyka?"

Kramen scanned the empty street one last time, his grip tightening on his gun. His voice was cold, sharp, and final.

"Nowhere..."
