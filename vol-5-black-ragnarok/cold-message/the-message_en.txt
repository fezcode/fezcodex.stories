# The Cold Message

The sea off the coast of **Oakhaven** didn't roar; it whispered. It told the few souls listening that they were small, that the past was just silt on the ocean floor, and that peace was something caught, not kept.

**Soren Perborn** stood on the docks, gutting a mackerel with a precision that belonged in a surgery theater, not a fish market. To the locals, he was just a fixture of the harbor—weathered like the wood, quiet as the fog. They noticed he walked with a stiffness in his left leg, but they called it rheumatism. They didn't know it was a titanium pin from a three-story fall in Glareach. They noticed he never sat with his back to the door at the tavern, but they called it eccentricity, not protocol.

He had retired five years ago. He had walked away from **Black Ragnarok**—the agency that didn't exist, serving the kingdom that doesn't care. He had traded the silence of the night for the sound of the waves. He thought he was out.

Then the mail came.

It wasn't a digital ping. Black Ragnarok knew better. It was a paper envelope, yellowed and anonymous. Soren didn't open it at the mailbox. He waited until he was inside, blinds drawn, the fire popping in the grate. He ran a thumb over the seal, checking for tampering, before slicing it open with the knife he’d just cleaned.

Inside, a single sheet of paper.

*"It was cold in the mountains."*

He stared at the words. To anyone else, a weather report. To him, an alarm bell ringing in an empty house.

"Cold in the mountains." Code 7-Alpha. Total compromise. The structure had collapsed.

His expression didn't change. The fisherman vanished, peeling away like dead skin. In his place stood something harder, something that had been waiting in the dark.

Freya was in danger. And she couldn't go to the organization. She had sent this to him because he was the only variable they couldn't control.

Soren tossed the letter into the fire. He watched the paper curl, the code turning to ash.

He moved to the bedroom, shoving the heavy oak wardrobe aside. The floorboards groaned as he pried them up. Wrapped in oilcloth lay the tools of a trade he swore he’d forgotten.

He unwrapped the bundle. The black tactical suit, reinforced and silent. The suppressed sidearm, heavy and cold. There were no high-tech gadgets, no glowing lenses. Just steel, kevlar, and the tools of a man who worked best when the lights went out.

He checked the magazine. Full. He racked the slide. The sound was a mechanical affirmation.

"You can retire the man," he whispered to the empty room. "But how do you kill a ghost?"

He packed the bag. He wouldn't be on the docks tomorrow. He was going back to the city, to the noise and the filth.

Soren Perborn was done fishing.
