# The Lighthouse of Ash

"How many times can you watch a man be buried, Orinor?" The Fox asked, his voice barely rising above the rhythmic thrum of the boat's engine. "By my count, I've seen you die at least five times."

"Once, Fox. Just once," **Orinor** replied, his gaze locked on the jagged horizon. "A man can only die once. The rest is just theater."

They were cutting through the black water toward the **Abandoned Lighthouse**, a solitary, broken needle of stone piercing the sky on the rocky coastline of **Glareach**. The mist here was heavy, clinging to the ruins of the old district like a shroud over a corpse that refused to rot.

"Where do you think she is right now?" Fox asked, his hand tightening on the tiller.

Orinor didn't answer. He stared at the lighthouse, looming closer with every swell of the waves. "Why a lighthouse?" he muttered.

Fox frowned, shouting over the wind. "What?"

"Why does every road lead me back to the water?" Orinor asked, frustration cracking his voice. "I was a fisherman. I found peace in the rhythm of the tides. I was done. But this... this lighthouse feels like an ending. Why is it always the sea?"

Fox cut the engine, letting the boat drift toward the rotting dock. He looked at his old friend, really looked at him, for the first time in years. "I've never seen you this shattered, Ori."

"Why a lighthouse?" Orinor repeated, the question hanging in the damp air like a curse.

They made landfall on the slick rocks. Their bags were heavy with the weight of a war they thought they had finished, but the two old men shouldered them with practiced ease. As they climbed the creaking wooden steps to the lighthouse entrance, a figure stepped out from the shadows of the doorway.

**Palwin Condervale**.

Orinor stopped dead. He hadn't seen her in years. She looked older, her face etched with lines that spoke of hard choices, but her eyes were the same—sharp, cold, and assessing. Like a blade kept in velvet.

Fox touched Orinor's shoulder. "Don't get mad. I know for a fact you wouldn't call her even if you were bleeding out, so I did the logistics. You can thank me later."

Palwin stood there, immobile as a statue. Orinor mirrored her. The history between them made the air thin.

Fox broke the silence, clapping his hands together with forced cheer. "We need all the manpower—and womanpower—we can get." He smiled, a wide, jagged grin that stretched the scar tissue on his cheek. "What a foolish thing it is to fall in love, isn't it?"

Palwin ignored the comment and gestured them inside. The interior of the lighthouse had been transformed into a makeshift command center. Maps, satellite photos, and decrypted dossier files plastered the curved stone walls.

"This is everything we have on Freya's status," Palwin said, her voice cool, precise, and professional. She hadn't left **Black Ragnarok**; she had simply become part of its furniture. Fox had called in a favor, and she had accepted. Tying up loose ends meant finishing the agency, one way or another.

"Why a lighthouse?" Orinor asked again, turning his gaze to Palwin.

"The only part of Glareach that wasn't rebuilt is this coastline," she said, tracing a line on the map. "The fires didn't touch the stone, and the developers didn't want the ghosts. It's a blind spot. Perfect for things that don't want to be found."

Orinor wasn't satisfied. "The whole city is a ruin. We could have picked anywhere."

Palwin offered a faint, dry smile. "What is wrong, fisherman? You don't like the sea anymore?"

Orinor looked around the cold stone walls. A profound sadness ate at his heart. The sea had been his escape, his penance, his peace. Now, it was just a border to a prison. He couldn't wrap his head around the betrayal of his own sanctuary.

"The silence of the sea shouldn't trick you," he said softly, more to himself than to them. "It just means the high waves are gathering strength."

The metaphor tasted like ash in his mouth. He realized, with a sudden, crushing clarity, that there was no peace waiting for him. He had thought he earned a quiet death. What a foolish idea. The sea was never peaceful; he had just been blind to the coming storm.

He looked down at his hands. They were coated in a fine, grey dust from the rusted railing—the **Ashes of Glareach**. Decades later, and the city still stained anyone who touched it. He rubbed his hands together, trying to wipe it away, but the grey smear seemed to have sunken into his pores.

Fox broke the mood, tapping a radio report pinned to the wall. "Something happened at the City Market. Someone hit the Mayor. The press is calling it the **Massacre of the Grenadiers**."

Orinor froze, his hands still rubbing together.

"They want you to come out, Orinor," Fox said grimly.

"How do you know they want Orinor?" Palwin asked, though the tilt of her head suggested she was testing him, not asking.

"Really?" Fox raised an eyebrow. "Grenades, Palwin. Grenades. Whom do you lure with grenades?"

Orinor stared at the ash on his hands. The Mayor. The civilians. The noise. It was a calling card written in blood and fire.

"How do we trace ghosts?" Orinor asked, his voice hollow.

For once, the room fell silent. Even Palwin had no immediate answer.

"I will start with the Massacre," Fox said, grabbing his gear. "The ballistics will talk."

Palwin was already shrugging into her heavy trench coat. "Predymesh it is, then."

As they prepared to step back out into the cold wind, Orinor turned to Fox.

"It was four," Orinor said.

Fox paused, his hand on the doorframe. He looked back, genuinely confused. "What?"

"You saw me die four times," Orinor said, his eyes locking with his old friend's, searching for a flinch. "Not five."

Fox's face fell. The confusion melted into a look of profound shock, followed by a sadness so deep it seemed to age him ten years in a second.

"Must have been a mistake," Fox whispered, turning away to hide his eyes.

"Must have been," Orinor said.
