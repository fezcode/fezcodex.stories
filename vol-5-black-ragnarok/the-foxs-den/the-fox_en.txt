# The Fox's Den

**Predymesh**, the capital. A city that wore its corruption like expensive jewelry. Orinor Perborn loved it. He loved the chaos, the crowded streets where he could lose himself and forget who he was. The smog and the noise were the perfect cover for a man with too many ghosts.

He wasn't there for the scenery. He was there for **Vancelor Ivarel**.

Vancelor—known to the files of Black Ragnarok as "**The Fox**"—had done what few agents ever managed: he had left alive. It cost him his left eye and his career, but he had traded them for a townhouse in the suburbs, a wife who smiled like sunrise, and three children who would never know that their father used to dismantle governments for a living.

Vancelor returned home at 4:00 PM sharp, the chaotic energy of three school-aged children swirling around his legs. He looked softer now, the sharp angles of his face padded by a few years of peace and good cooking. He opened his front door, expecting the smell of dinner and the sound of silence.

Instead, he heard laughter.

His wife, Elara, was sitting in the parlor, pouring tea. Opposite her, looking like a dark stain on the pristine floral upholstery, sat Orinor.

Orinor was smiling—a rare, jagged expression that didn't quite reach his eyes. "And then," Orinor said, his voice gravelly, "the boat tipped over, and I lost the biggest catch of the season."

Elara laughed, a bright, innocent sound that made Vancelor's blood run cold.

"Vanc!" she exclaimed, seeing him. "Look who dropped by! An old colleague of yours from the... logistics firm? Orinor, was it?"

Vancelor stood frozen in the doorway, the color draining from his face. The patch over his left eye seemed to throb. He ushered the children upstairs with a gentleness that betrayed his shaking hands, then walked into the parlor.

He extended a hand to Orinor. To an observer, it was a greeting. To them, it was a threat assessment.

"You are putting my family at the very center of a dangerous situation," Vancelor whispered, his voice a hiss as he gripped Orinor's hand.

Orinor laughed, patting Vancelor on the shoulder. "Good to see you too, Fox."

"Elara," Vancelor said, his voice tight. "Could you give us a moment? Top secret logistics talk."

Elara rolled her eyes but smiled, picking up the tea tray. "Don't bore him to death, honey."

As soon as the door clicked shut, the temperature in the room dropped ten degrees. Vancelor spun around, his single eye burning with fury.

"Get out," he snarled. "I don't know why you're here, Orinor, but you need to leave. Now. I spent ten years burying that life. You don't get to dig it up in my living room."

Orinor didn't move. He sat calmly, watching his old friend pace. When Vancelor lunged to grab his arm, Orinor stood up—fast, fluid, undeniable. He grabbed Vancelor by the collar of his cardigan, pinning him against the bookshelf.

"I heard that it was cold in the mountains," Orinor said.

The fight went out of Vancelor instantly. He slumped, his grip on Orinor's arm loosening.

"Fuck," Vancelor breathed. "They found her."

Orinor let him go. Vancelor stumbled back, running a hand through his thinning hair. The domestic facade was gone; The Fox was back, calculating odds in a room full of throw pillows.

"If they found Freya," Vancelor muttered, "they're scrubbing the roster. They're tying up loose ends." He looked at the door where his family had just exited. "We're the loose ends."

"I didn't ask for your help," Orinor said quietly. "But I needed to know if you were safe."

"Safe?" Vancelor let out a bitter laugh. "I know why you came, Orinor. You don't check on friends. You recruit assets."

Vancelor walked to the bookshelf, pushing aside a vase to reveal a small, framed photograph tucked in the shadows. It was old, grainy. Freya stood in the center, looking fierce. Vancelor was laughing, two eyes bright and clear. And in the background, barely visible, a blurry figure turned away from the camera. Orinor.

"The good old days," Vancelor said, the irony dripping from his words like poison.

He looked back at the door. "I need to put my family to safety first. My wife's sister in the country..."

"It won't matter," Orinor said, his voice flat. "As long as we are alive, they will not be safe. The only way to protect them is to finish what started in the mountains."

Vancelor stared at the photo for a long moment, then nodded. The resignation was heavy on his shoulders.

"What a foolish thing to fall in love, isn't it?" Vancelor asked, his voice soft.

Orinor turned his head, looking out the window at the grey sky of Predymesh.

"At least something to fight for."
