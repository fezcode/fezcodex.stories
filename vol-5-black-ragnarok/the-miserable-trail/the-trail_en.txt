# The Miserable Trail

"When we find Klaude—and if we ever find him—we'll need three things," **The Fox** said, his voice echoing slightly in the damp, claustrophobic safehouse. He paced in front of **Granold Rolnifeld**, counting off on his fingers like a teacher lecturing a slow student.

"One: The Fuel. **Ash of Glareach**. This is the easy part. The city is still a graveyard. The ash coats everything."

He held up a second finger. "Two: The Key. A drop of blood. Consent would be polite, but we don't have the luxury of manners. Rolnifeld will provide it, whether he likes it or not."

He paused, a dark smile playing on his lips. "And three: The Toll. A day of life."

He looked down at Rolnifeld, who was still tied to the rusted bedframe. "Oh, wouldn't he love to trade the day of the attack? But the Chronometer doesn't work like that. He will lose a day of his future to reclaim an hour of his past."

"Of course," Fox added, turning to the others, "that's assuming we even find Klaude."

"What a messy road ahead," **Palwin** muttered, leaning against the peeling wallpaper. "We need to find **Niva DeRosa**, we need to decode her report, we need to find the source of the eleven-hour heartbeats, we need to find a myth like Klaude, and we are stuck dragging this anchor." She gestured angrily at Rolnifeld.

**Soren Perborn** was silent. He stood still, staring at a crack in the floor, but his mind was miles away, walking down a memory lane paved with broken glass. Twenty-two stars.

Time was not kind to anyone, but for the man with the green beret—**Lorhud Krauper**—time had been a hostile invader. What a man he was. A ghost who refused to fade until the work was done.

"We need to see the city first," Soren said suddenly, breaking his silence.

"What are we going to do with him?" Palwin asked, jerking a thumb at Rolnifeld.

"He comes with us," Soren answered.

"How?" Palwin asked, looking to Fox for support. Fox shrugged, clearly deferring to Soren's instinct.

Soren walked over to Rolnifeld. He leaned down, his face inches from the disgraced Major's.

"Do you want retribution?" Soren asked him again, his voice low and hard.

Rolnifeld looked up. His eyes were red-rimmed, hollowed out by grief. He didn't care about the case. He didn't care about the thirteen civilians or the Mayor. Does that make me a monster? he thought. Probably. But the guilt eating him alive wasn't for the city. It was for her.

"I want to know," Rolnifeld whispered. "I want to know everything. I could have saved her."

"Why do you want to find Niva?" Soren pressed.

"Because I didn't trust her then," Rolnifeld admitted, his voice breaking. "And now she's the only truth left in this city."

"The road to the lighthouse is long," Soren said, straightening up. "We need to bring him with us until we put him in the chair. Palwin, you watch him."

Palwin scowled but nodded. She was given the task of taking care of him. A double agent—God knows whose side she was truly on—was now guarding their only lead.

"How can we trust him?" Fox asked quietly.

"We don't," Soren said. "We trust the misery."

Soren walked to the window, peering out through the grime at the sleeping city. "Predymesh listens. Predymesh watches. Predymesh smells."

"The sewer dwellers?" Fox asked, skeptical. "They are myths, Soren. Ghost stories for children."

"The misery follows them, and they follow the misery," Soren said. "They will lead us to Klaude."

"What if we don't find Niva?" Palwin asked.

"We can still continue with the investigation," Fox suggested. "We really don't need her to uncover the case if we have the files."

"Wrong," Soren said sharply. "She knew more than she was letting on. She hid something. That's what made her go mad after her father's death."

He began to pace, his energy nervous and frantic. "Not just the misplaced evidence, but the whole setup. Is she never seen again? Did she disappear? Or did she create a whole new life to find out about the case, to conduct her own investigation? I read about her academy days. I read about her childhood."

Soren's eyes burned with intensity. "She never had a mother, but she loved her aunt as one. Niva was fierce. She was strong. She was the daughter of **The King of the Sewers**. She didn't just disappear."

Soren pulled a folded photograph from his pocket and slammed it onto the table. It was a grainy surveillance shot of a flickering neon sign in a rainy alleyway.

The sign read: **Corrigan Investigations**.

"We need Niva," Soren said, his voice grim. "And to find her, we need a professional."
