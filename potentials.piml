    (conflict) Lorhud Krauper wants an hour to see Lenia. The Sultan wants an hour to prove Galar's murder. He knows looking backward turns the soul to stone.
    (hook) "I sell ghosts, not second chances."

    (archetype) The Whisper Broker
    (concept) A disfigured socialite running exclusive poker games in the St. Marlowe Hotel. He trades in secrets, holding the ledger of Aester Cloudwear's crimes and the formula for the Soul of Viyu.

    (archetype) The Petal-Marked
    (concept) A victim of the 'Touch of Rose' who, instead of entering a vegetative state, began to see the 'True Thornus'—a layered reality where the city's corruption manifests as physical rot and its secrets as glowing embers.

    (archetype) The Verity-Weigher
    (concept) In Thornus, profound truths possess physical mass. The government employs 'Weight-Checkers' who use precision scales to verify the honesty of scientific reports and diplomatic dispatches.
    (conflict) Avalia Krones must craft her reports using 'Half-Truths'—sentences that are technically accurate but contextually empty—to mimic the physical weight of a productive breakthrough.
    (hook) "A lie is light as air. The truth will break your scales."
