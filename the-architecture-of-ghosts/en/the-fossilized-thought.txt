# Part I: The Fossilized Thought (The Hardware)

The **Proxanian Seeds** are not seeds in any sense that a human farmer would understand. They are not biological life waiting to bloom into flora; they are fossilized neural nodes. In the permafrost of **Proxan Mountain**, they look like jagged, black opals—stagnant pieces of an ancient architecture.

When the Children of the Mountain were born, they did not have a name until a Seed was grafted into the base of their skull. The Seed would grow, not upward into the light, but inward into the gray matter. It was a biological installation. The result was the crimson leaf-mark on the forehead—a port for a network that spanned the entire mountain.

When I added these ground-up "seeds" to the Krones Formula, I thought I was creating a system for plants to share nutrients. I didn't realize that the Seeds are opportunists. They do not care if the host is a stalk of wheat or a human child. 

In the victims of the **Touch of Rose**, the Seed has successfully "booted up." It has high-jacked the host's nervous system, turning the brain into a high-density biological receiver. The rose-leaf mark is the antenna. It is beautiful, it is crimson, and it is starving for a signal.

Without the other two parts of the Trinity, the Seed is a locked door. A "vegetative state" is simply a human mind being held hostage by a piece of ancient hardware that refuses to let the soul speak until the network connection is established.
