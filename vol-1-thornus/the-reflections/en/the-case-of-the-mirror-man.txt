The _acid rain_ came down in sheets, washing the grime from the cobblestones into the sewers, a baptism
for a city that had sold its soul for a few more drops of industry. My head throbbed in time with the
_flickering_ neon sign outside my office window. The sign said "**Corrigan Investigations**." The bottle of
bourbon on my desk said "**Old Grand-Dad**." **Both were liars**. I hadn't investigated much of anything
lately, and there was nothing grand about my life.

The call came from a public phone just before midnight. _Some rookie cop_, his voice trembling like a
leaf in a hurricane. A **John Doe**, face-down in an alley off 4th street. **My beat. My problem.**

When the coroner, a stooped old man with spectacles thick as ale bottles, rolled the body over, the
city's hum faded. The face staring up at the smog-choked sky was my own. Same busted nose from that
union dispute, same cynical sneer, same fresh scar above my left eye where a dame had gotten lucky with
a whiskey glass last week. This wasn't just a look-alike. _**This was me**_.

"You know him, Corrigan?" the rookie asked, his awe mixing with _fear_.

"He's a ghost," I rasped, _lighting a cigarette that tasted like ash and dread_. **"Let me work"**

I took the case. Who else could? I was hunting my own killer.

The clues were a breadcrumb trail leading straight into my own fractured past. A matchbook from "The
Tipsy Lizard," a dive bar where I'd been thrown out a month ago. A claim-ticket for my own tweed
suit. A single, blurry photograph of a woman I'd loved and lost, a memory I kept buried under a
mountain of bad debts and worse decisions.

I was _chasing a ghost_, and the closer I got, the more he felt like my own. I'd wake up in my apartment,
**my knuckles bruised** and no memory of a fight. I'd find notes in my own handwriting, cryptic warnings
I didn't remember writing. "**He's getting closer**," one said. "**He knows what you did**."

The city became a hall of mirrors, and every reflection was the dead man. I saw him in shop windows, a
phantom behind my own shoulder. I saw him in the rearview mirror of my beat-up Impala. The folk I
questioned—bartenders, informants, loan-sharks—they were all describing me. My habits. My temper. My
sorrow.

The final clue was a _key_, hanging on a nail in my own office. A key to a room at the St. Marlowe
hotel, a flophouse for has-beens and never-weres. I knew the room. It was the one I'd been renting for
weeks, for the nights when my own apartment felt too much like a _tomb_. The place I'd gone after she
died.

I went in, my .38 revolver cold and heavy in my hand. The room was _empty_, save for a single chair
facing a full-length mirror propped against the wall. On the floor was a bottle of bourbon and a
glass. _My brand_.

**_And I understood._**

There was no doppelganger. _No conspiracy_. Just a man so broken by grief he'd split in two. He'd been
leaving a trail for himself, a desperate attempt by one half of his mind to make the other half see
the truth. The body in the alley—was it real? A **_stranger_** I'd killed in a blackout? Or just the first,
most powerful delusion? It didn't matter. The case was the same. A man was hunting the part of
himself he could no longer live with. The part that lost her.

I stood before the mirror. I saw him there. The killer I'd been hunting. _Haggard_. _Haunted_. His eyes
full of the same self-hatred that burned in my own gut.

I had finally cornered my man. There was **no escape**. Not for **_him_**. Not for **_me_**.

I raised the **_revolver_**. The man in the glass **_did the same_**.

**_"Case closed," I whispered._**
