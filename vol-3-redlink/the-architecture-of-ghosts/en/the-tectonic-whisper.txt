# Part II: The Tectonic Whisper (The Signal)

The **Proxanian Echo** is the ghost in the machine. It is a low-frequency, persistent vibration emitted by the crystalline veins of **Proxan Mountain**. It is not sound; it is data.

When the Proxanians were alive, they were never alone. The Echo was their collective consciousness—an operating system that synchronized every heartbeat, every memory, and every law of their civilization. It was the background radiation of their souls. When they vanished, the signal didn't stop. The mountain is still broadcasting to an empty room.

In the city, the Echo is faint—a whisper in the tectonic plates. But for those with the **Touch of Rose**, it is deafening. Their brains, hijacked by the **Proxanian Seeds**, are tuned to this frequency. They are vegetative because they are "listening" with everything they have. They are trying to decrypt a ghost signal that their human biology cannot process.

This is the cruelty of the Trinity. The Seed provides the antenna, and the Echo provides the call. But without a proper conductor, the two can only create static. The victims are trapped in a perpetual loop of "Searching for Connection...", their eyes fixed on a horizon that only the dead can see.
