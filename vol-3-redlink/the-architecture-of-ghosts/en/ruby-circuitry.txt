# Part III: Ruby Circuitry (The Conductor)

The **Sansu Syrup** is the blood of the ghost. Found in the pressurized veins of the mountain, this iridescent gold fluid is the only medium capable of carrying the **Proxanian Echo** without degradation. It is biological fiber-optics.

In its natural state, it is a holy relic. But in the hands of Dr. Corshield and his "Agitators," it is a weapon. When combined with the **Soul of Viyu**, the gold iridescence dies, turning into a violent, deep-spectrum **Crimson**. This Agitated Syrup is 10,000 times more conductive than any metal known to man.

This is the final piece of the bridge. When injected into a "Rose-Marked" subject, the Agitated Syrup replaces the natural circulatory system. The veins become wires. The lungs stop, for the syrup carries all the oxygen the hardware requires. 

The **RedLink** occurs when the Syrup allows the **Proxanian Echo** to finally reach the **Proxanian Seed**. The antenna finally has its signal. The human mind is finally bypassed.

Twelve units, linked by a river of liquid ruby light, no longer dreaming, no longer human. They are a single, multi-core biological engine, running an ancient civilization's ghost-code. The Trinity is complete. The silence is over. And the mountain has finally found a way to walk through the streets of Predymesh.
