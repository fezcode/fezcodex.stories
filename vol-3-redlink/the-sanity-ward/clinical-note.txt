# Clinical Note: The Hysteria of the Moth

**Subject:** The so-called "Sultan of Butterflies" (Widow Freiton)
**Observer:** Dr. Brann Corshield, Chief Alienist, St. Jude’s Asylum

I looked up from my desk. On the opposite wall, the oil painting of me receiving the "Key to Craninal" seemed to nod in agreement. It is a magnificent piece, capturing the steel in my eyes, the commanding set of my jaw. It is one of three hundred and twelve portraits I have commissioned. A man of my intellect *should* be documented. Future generations will need reference material when they build statues in my honor.

I adjusted my silk tie in the reflection of the silver tea service—another portrait, fleeting but perfect.

"She is a cancer," I dictated to my trembling stenographer. "A chaotic anomaly in the ordered mind of our society."

The widow Freiton. She calls herself a comedian. A revolutionary. I call her what she is: a hysteric. A broken woman who could not process the simple, natural death of her husband and instead invented a fairy tale about glowing energy and government assassins.

And the people... the sheep... they listen to her! They wear those ridiculous pins. They laugh at her jokes as if they are scripture. It is an insult to Reason. It is an insult to *me*.

I am the architect of the public mind. I have cured the unruly. I have silenced the loud. When Aester Cloudwear—a man of vision, almost my equal—came to me with concerns about her "cult," I assured him the solution was clinical, not criminal.

Martyrs are made by bullets. Madwomen are unmade by white walls and quiet rooms.

I walked to the window, catching a glimpse of my reflection in the glass. Impeccable.

"Draft the warrant," I commanded. "Cite 'Public Endangerment' and 'Acute Delusional Paranoia.' We will bring her here. To St. Jude's."

I turned to the portrait above the fireplace—Me, in a toga, holding the scales of Justice.

"I will not just lock her up," I whispered to my painted self. "I will dismantle her. I will peel away the 'Sultan' layer by layer until only the weeping widow remains. And when she finally admits that Galarian Freiton died of a weak heart, I will be there to accept her apology."

I smiled. It was a dazzling smile. I really must have a painter capture this lighting.

"The Butterflies think they are free," I said, picking up a scalpel from my tray. "But every insect looks better pinned under glass."
