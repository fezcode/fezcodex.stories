### **ST. JUDE’S ASYLUM: RESTRICTED WING**
**OBSERVATION LOG: REDLINK PROTOCOL 0-12**
**SUBJECTS:** 12 Units (Classification: Rose-Marked, Grade IV)
**CATALYST:** Agitated Sansu Syrup (Batch #PX-99 / Viyu-Infused)
**CLASSIFICATION:** LEVEL ALPHA (GOVERNMENT EYES ONLY)

**[02:14 AM] - RECEIPT OF PAYLOAD**
The lead-lined canisters arrived from the **Proxan Mountain** excavation site under heavy military escort. The **Sansu Syrup** remains in its raw, iridescent state, though the containment field is struggling to dampen the high-frequency vibrations. Per Protocol, the fluid was pressurized with **Soul of Viyu** gas. Upon contact, the gold iridescence died instantly, replaced by a violent, deep-spectrum **Crimson**. Compatibility with the biological marks is estimated at 99%.

**[03:45 AM] - THE INFUSION**
Twelve subjects were secured in the circular 'Transistor Ward.' All subjects are in advanced **Touch of Rose** stasis. The forehead marks—the crimson leaf-shapes—remain dark. 

Injection began via simultaneous spinal tap. Total volume: 50ml of Agitated Sansu per unit.

**[04:12 AM] - THE PROXANIAN ECHO**
Initial response: Subjects’ core temperatures dropped to near-hypothermic levels. At 04:15, the "Echo" manifested. It is a sub-vocal hum—the remnant frequency of the **Children of the Mountain**. It does not enter through the ears; it vibrates the floor, the walls, and the ribcages of everyone in the wing. 

The forehead marks have begun to emit light. The red veins beneath the subjects' skin are now visible, glowing with the Agitated Sansu as it replaces the natural circulatory flow.

**[04:30 AM] - REDLINK FORMATION**
The breakthrough occurred at 04:31. Subject-01 and Subject-02 reached Viyu-synchronization. A filament of red energy—thick and viscous like **liquid ruby**—stretched from the center of Subject-01’s forehead mark and anchored into Subject-02. 

Within ninety seconds, the filament had traveled the entire circle. The twelve subjects are now physically and metaphysically tethered. This is the **RedLink**. The energy is not a spark or a bolt; it is a slow-moving, glowing river of syrup suspended in mid-air, pulsing in time with a heartbeat that belongs to none of them.

**[04:55 AM] - SENSORY ANOMALY (INCIDENT 44-B)**
Ward Orderly accidentally crossed the path of a RedLink filament while attempting to stabilize a Subject’s restraints. He experienced an immediate **"Flash-Drown."** He collapsed instantly, claiming he was "submerged in the collective memory of an extinct race." He reported hearing twelve separate hearts beating as one massive, hollow drum. Orderly has been moved to the Sanity Ward; his pupils remain in the 'Proxanian Black' state.

**[05:20 AM] - THE STATIC TRUTH**
Subjects have ceased pulmonary respiration. The Agitated Sansu has rendered oxygen unnecessary for the duration of the Link. The **RedLink** is now a perfect, stable halo of crimson light.

Dr. Corshield is observing from the control balcony. He notes that the "Static"—the background noise of human thought—is being filtered out. The RedLink is creating a high-fidelity window into the **True Thornus.** 

**[06:00 AM] - LOG END**
The Link is holding. The subjects’ eyes are open, yet fixed on a single coordinate in the near-future. The weight of the air in the room has increased significantly. We are no longer observing twelve patients; we are observing a single, twelve-core biological engine.

**Doctor’s Note (Corshield):** 
*"The Proxanians are dead, but their lifeblood is the key to our future. The RedLink is more than a connection; it is a leash. With enough Agitated Sansu, we will see every sin before it is committed. Proceed to 24-Unit expansion immediately. The Sultan thinks she is playing a game, but we have already seen the final move."*
