# The Medal of Ash

The heavy gold disc felt like a lead weight around my neck. It was the **Government's Medal for Scientific Achievement**, the highest honor a citizen of **Thornus** could receive. As the cameras flashed and the officials clapped, I forced a smile that didn't reach my eyes. 

To the world, I am **Avalia Krones**, the architect of the **Agricultural Revolution**. To the government, I am their greatest asset. To myself, I am a liar.

"A toast to Dr. Krones!" a high-ranking official boomed, his breath smelling of expensive wine and old secrets. "For the **Krones Formula**, which turned our barren fields into breadbaskets. You have ended hunger, Avalia. Now, help us end the resistance."

I nodded, my fingers tracing the cold edge of the medal. They didn't understand. The Krones Formula wasn't just about faster farming. It was about life. But in their hands, the same acceleration that grows wheat in a week could be used to grow toxic spores in a day. They wanted a weapon. I gave them a puzzle with the most important pieces missing.

Every report I submit is a masterpiece of obfuscation. I hide the true potential of my work behind layers of complex, unnecessary mathematics. I make the breakthroughs look like accidents and the dead ends look like progress. 

It is a dangerous game.

Later that night, I sat in my laboratory, the sterile white lights reflecting off the glass vials. I wasn't alone. A small, origami butterfly sat on my workbench—a signal.

The **Butterflies** think I'm on their side. They want me to leak the formula, to give the resistance a way to sustain their armies. They want to burn the government down. But I have seen what happens when fire meets hunger. I don't want a revolution; I want a resolution.

I whispered to the empty room, "If I give the government the weapon, the world dies. If I give the rebels the food, the war never ends."

I am the bridge that neither side can afford to cross. I am the silence between two screams. 

I picked up the origami butterfly and carefully unfolded it. Inside, there was no message, just a single, dried petal of a blue flower. A reminder of what we are fighting for. Not power. Not victory. Just the right to grow something without it being turned into a grave.

The government thinks they own me. The Butterflies think they lead me. 

But as I looked at the Krones Formula shimmering on my screen, I knew the truth. I am the one holding the scale. And I will keep it balanced, even if the weight of it crushes me.
